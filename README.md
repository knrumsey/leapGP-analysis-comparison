# leapGP Analysis and Comparison
R code for analysis of leapGP/laGP on the twin galaxies function (Rumsey et al., 2022) and the piston function (Surjanovic 2015). This code can be used to reproduce all tables and figures in the submission to ??? (update when accepted). 
Note that code for implementation of leapGP is maintained in the `quack` R package which can be installed via

```{R}
devtools::install_github("knrumsey/quack")
```
